# Stashr

Stashr is a goal-tracking web app that helps you manage your savings. It allows users to set a goal, deposit or withdraw money, and keep track of transaction history with the ability to edit or undo transactions. The app includes a progress bar to show how close you are to reaching your goal.

### Features:

    Set a Goal: Add a goal name and the amount you want to save.
    Progress Tracking: Visualize your progress with a progress bar that updates in real time.
    Add Deposits and Withdrawals: Record money added or withdrawn from your savings.
    Transaction History: View a detailed history of all deposits and withdrawals with timestamps.
    Edit and Undo Transactions: Modify or undo transactions to keep your records accurate.
    Goal Reset: Reset all data to start over with a new goal.

### How It Works:

    Set Your Goal:
        Input the goal name (e.g., "Holiday Fund") and the total amount you want to save.
    Add Transactions:
        Deposit or withdraw money to see your progress increase or decrease.
        Transactions are timestamped and added to the transaction history.
    View Your Progress:
        A progress bar shows the percentage of savings towards your goal.
        A detailed list of transactions allows you to keep track of every deposit and withdrawal.
    Edit Transactions:
        You can edit the amount or date of any transaction. The time is preserved automatically, and only the date is editable.
    Reset the Goal:
        Reset everything to clear all data and start fresh with a new goal.
